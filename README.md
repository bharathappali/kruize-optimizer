# Kruize Optimizer

> ### Tag It | Forget It | Optimize It 

A lightweight Quarkus‑based microservice that automates configuration, experiment creation, profile validation, and health orchestration for Kruize Autotune, simplifying the experience for SREs and Platform Engineers.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Kind (local development)

```bash
kubectl apply -k deployment/overlays/kind
```

This deploys to the `monitoring` namespace.

### Deploy to OpenShift

```bash
kubectl apply -k deployment/overlays/openshift
```

This deploys to the `openshift-tuning` namespace.


## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```


## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.jar.type=uber-jar
```

The application, packaged as an _über-jar_, is now runnable using `java -jar target/*-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/kruize-optimizer-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult <https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling>.
